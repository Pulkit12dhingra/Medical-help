# Medical Help

I created this project after being inspired by Baymax of the movie Big Hero 6. This project is based on web Scraping of the site www.1mg.com, I am really thankful to them.

Libraries used in the project are (I encourage to read their documentation not just use them blind-folded):-

Tkinter:-(Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html )
Sqlite3:-(Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html )
Requests:-(Documentation:-https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
Beautifulsoup:-(Documentation:-https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/ )
Pillow:-(Documentation:-https://pillow.readthedocs.io/ )
OS:-(Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html )
Since the project uses GUI i.e.. Graphical User Interphase thus It has 3 windows or rather 3 functions

<ul>
  <li>Login Page</li>
  <li>Signup Page</li>
  <li>Main Page</li>
</ul>

## Login Page:-
As the name suggests it's a login page window where you can log in from preregistered ID. It's the default page that opens and you can be diverted to the signup page just by the press of a button.

## Signup Page:-
Well new user to medical help, come on let's know each other pls enter your details we'll send you an OTP email confirmation for email Verification so make sure it's valid and pls don't reply cuz it's just a business purpose mail. All set now back to login page.....

## Main Page:-
Okay so successfully login, well the hard work of remembering the password is done. Now type the name of the desired medicine you want to search for. Whatever textual information about the medicine would be there on the parent site would be displayed on your screen in a moment. Make sure you are connected to the internet

## ------------------------------
I used MySQL database but you may use the database of your choice. It's just the accurate one for the cause

Play with the code to know more about it.

Hey!!

It was my first project and I learned a lot while making it. I hope it will teach you the same.....

# Enjoyyy.............!!! :)
